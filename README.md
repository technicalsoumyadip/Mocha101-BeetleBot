## 📖 About This Setup

**BrewLand** is a dotfiles configuration that blends style, performance, and minimalism into one cohesive Hyprland experience. Built heavily around the [Catppuccin Mocha and Latte](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) palettes, it delivers rich colors, smooth animations, and zero fluff.

Think of it as the perfect espresso shot for your Linux desktop: **smooth, bold, and just the right amount of aesthetic kick.**
